way 2

it lets you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on github.

git pull origin main-

use to fetch and download content from a remote repo and immediately update the local 
repo to match that content.

resolving merge conflicts-

An event that takes place when git is unable to  automatically  resolve differences
in code between two commits.

-----------------------------------------


undoing changes

case 1 : staged changes (added but not commited)

git reset <file-name> - git reset index.html
git reset - for multiple files

case 2 : commited changes(for one commit)
git reset HEAD~1 - latest commit is call head, so reset head by 1 step,go 1 step back.

git log - to see all commmits history

q - to quit

case 3 : commited changes (for many commits)

git reset <commit-hash>-git reset  4670244b345d547acde8768353ab44002583a294(commit-hash)

git reset --hard <commit-hash> - to remove from ide code and git code also

------------------------------

fork 

A fork is a new repository  that shares  code and visibility settings 
with the original "upstream" repository

fork is a rough copy - same code and same setting of the forked one.

- mainly copy code of other person in our account.

we can fix other code and create pull request to contribute in other person code.
